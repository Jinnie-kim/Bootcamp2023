        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from India. They have also partially
        hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult
        male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capon">capon</a>. An
        adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans<sup><a href="somesource.com">[2]</a></sup> keep chickens
        primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still
        practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade found in the
        Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern
        Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between
        Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8]
